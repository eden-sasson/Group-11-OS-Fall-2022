Paragraph 1: Experience with NACHOS
The layout of instructions to install Nachos were fairly simple, however prior knowledge of UNIX
and specifically the FIU servers was definitely necessary. The TA video and walkthrough 
was very detailed and helped confirm that we were doing everything correctly. In order to get
the files onto the system we found 2 methods that worked well: 1) using a terminal in mac to 
run the line "scp -r nachos-3.4-linux <user id>@ocelot.aul.fiu.edu:~/<path to nachosdir>"
2) utilize a FTP Client like Filezilla to move the files to the server. Reading into the 
nachos files and directories was definitely overwhelming for us. Our experience creating 
Makefiles and other UNIX programs did not seem to be at Nachos creation level. There will need
to be much more time spent in order to become proficient in the Nachos environment. 

Paragraph 2: Experience with the Tests
After getting the files onto the server, running the tests was straightforward with the step-
by-step guide. All of the tests ran correctly the first run through. Again, the TA video
was very useful in confirming values and following along properly. The analytics returned
helped understand what was going on especially in the step through test. 

Paragraph 3: The Thread Class
The threads directory contains the main Nachos operating system interface that allows a user to make
system calls, run user programs, debug, see analytics, multithread kernel processes, etc.
The Thread class employs basic multithreading techniques (fork, finish, yield, sleep) to
manage threads and control memory usage. There is also a constructor for the thread type 
containing the necessary variables and initializes a thread control block.
